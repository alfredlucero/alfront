  Frontend Interview Notes for All Things HTML
  Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML
  - World Wide Web (WWW, W3): interconnected system of public webpages accessible through Internet, one of many applications on it
  -> HTTP protocol that governs data transfer between server and client
  -> client supplies unique universal identifier called URL (uniform resource location) or URI (uniform resource identifier)
  -> HTML (hypertext markup language) to publish web documents
  -> Linking or connecting sources through hyperlinks
  - Block elements form a visible block on a page, appear on a new line and any content that goes after will also appear on a new line
  i.e. p, div
  - Inline elements those contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts of the document's content, not entire paragraphs or groupings
  of content, will not cause a new line to appear in document i.e. a, em, strong, span
  - Specify attributes: extra information about element which you don't want to appear in actual content
  i.e. class, style, data-role, href, title, target
  i.e. boolean attributes like disabled, checked
  - <!DOCTYPE html> = shortrest string of characters that counts as valid doctype for HTML files
  - <html> wraps all content on entire page, root element
  - <head> acts as container for all stuff you want to include on HTML page that isn't content like keywords, page description for search results,
    CSS to style content
  - <meta charset="utf-8"> sets characterset your document should use to UTF-8 (most human written languages)
  - HTML parser reduces whitespace to single space when rendering code; add whitespace for code readability
  - special characters in HTL like &lt/gt/quot/apos/amp;
  - <meta> data that describes data about document
  i.e. <meta name="author" content="Alfred Lucero">
-->
<div>
  <p>Block level <span>Inline elements</span></p>
</div>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>

  HTML5 Semantics
  Source: https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/html-5-semantics/
  - Semantics: study of meaning and branch of logic and linguistics
  -> when computers understand the structure of a document and roles of elements inside it
  -> leads to more searchable content (better SEO), increases accessibility (ARIA) like for screen 
  -> separate HTML elements have their distinguishable structural roles apparent to browser and developer
  -> i.e. semantic elements before HTML5: <form>, <img>, <table>, <ol>, <ul>, <p>, <h1-6>
  -> non-semantic elements (no special meaning, illusory hierarchical relationships but used to style groups of content): <div>, <span>
  - Text Semantics: <strong>, <em>, <time> (human-readable date-times), <mark> (highlighted text)
  - Document Outline: <section> (sections grouped around a specific theme), <article> (complete or self-contained compositions like blog post or widget),
    <nav> (navigation blocks), <aside> (complementary content such as sidebars), <body>
  -> every sectioning element (body, article, section, nav, and aside) can have its own <header> and <footer>
  - Tips: outermost sectioning element is always <body>, sections in HTML5 can be nested, each section has its own heading hierarchy,
    first heading element defines heading of given section (other ones relative to this)
  -> <nav> and <aside> tags don't belong to main outline of HTML document and usually not rendered by assistive technologies
  -> each section (body, section, article, aside, nav) can have their own <header> and <footer> tags
  -> have a header for each section
  - using Outliner tool of html5.org you can see how search engines see it and screen readers read it to visually impaired users; should be
  semantic, well-structured and no nasty "Untitled" sections in it
  - follow WAI-ARIA accessibility protocol

    <h1></h1>
    <p></p>
  </header>

      <h2></h2>

  ARIA Web Standards and HTML Apps Accessibility
  Source: https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/aria-web-standards/
  - ARIA: Accessible Rich Internet Applications that users with disabilities can efficiently user
  -> published by Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), additional markup required, cross-platform
  - helps to define the purpose of different elements with help of landmark roles and describe nature
  with aria-prefixed attributes
  -> two types: properties that describe features less likely to change throughout page lifecycle,
  and states that provide information about things tha tmay frequently change due to user interaction
  - landmark roles to identify large perceivable regions on web page that assistive tech users may want to quickly access
  -> role="banner": content related to entire site i.e. main header of site for logo or site-wide information, use only once
  -> role="main": main content of document, use only once i.e. <main role="main">
  -> role="navigation": links and lists on site, navbar
  -> role="complementary": additional content related to main content of site, needs to be on similar level in DOM hierarchy as role="main"
  i.e. related posts, articles, comments
  -> role="contentinfo": informs user agents about presence of region where different kinds of metadata like copyright info,
  legal and privacy statements can be found i.e. used for footer of site
  -> role="form": form waiting for user input; search forms should use role="search"
  -> role="search": search functionality
  -> role="application": declare region as web app rather than web doc, not recommended to include this in websites as it switches
  from normal browsing mode to application browsing mode
  - roles help with defining the meaning of HTML tags; states and properties provide user with extra information on how to interact with the
  -> aria-prefixed attributes with syntax aria-* i.e. aria-required (permanent feature of input element and user must fill in, aria-checked for 
  checkboxes frequently changing value due to user interaction
  -> some may take token values (limited set of predefined values like aria-live), others may take strings, numbers, integers, ID refs, booleans
  -> build relationships between elements with relationship attributes
  i.e. aria-labelledby
  -> synchronize states and properties with element's lifecycle
  -> match visual and accessible interfaces i.e. selecting options in a form and using aria-selected
  - don't overuse ARIA: when using semantic tags of HTML5 like <button> or <form>, modern web browsers add appropriate ARIA semantics by default
    and makes no sense to separately set ARIA landmark roles i.e. no need to do <form role="form">,
    no need to use HTML's native attributes along with appropriate ARIA attribute like hidden HTML attribute to a form input doesn't need aria-hidden
-->
<nav role="navigation"></nav>
<main role="main" aria-labelledby="some-id">
  <h1 id="some-id"></h1>
</main>
<option value="value" aria-selected="true"></option>
