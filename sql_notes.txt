Learning SQL (more specifically, PostGreSQL):
- Spreadsheets for one-time analysis, chart, reasonable data set size, untrained people can work with data
- Databases for data integrity, massive amounts of data, different datasets, automate steps for re-use, support data for websites/apps
- Imagine tables, columns, rows
- PostgreSQL - free open source, widely used, multiplatform; SQLite - open source and mainly command line,
  MySQL/MariaSQL
- SQL = Structured Query Language to communicate with databases
- pgAdmin - popular graphical interface for PostgreSQL

- Restoring a database but only the table schema (table names and data types, no actual data)
-> restore .tar file and set only schema option
