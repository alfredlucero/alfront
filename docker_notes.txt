Docker and Containers
- more like a process, CRUD, networking, shelling into containers
- image basics, Docker Hub, Dockerfiles, push custom images, build images
- container lifetime and handling persistent data, docker volumes, bind mounts
- docker compose (multi-container automation), docker-compose.yml, docker-compose up
- docker swarm to build a cluster of nodes, overlay networks, routing mesh, swarm services for high availability containers
- stacks, secrets for config, app deploy lifecycle, local dev, CI testing, etc.

- Docker on Windows: 
Linux Containers (default) and Windows Containers

- Docker for Mac Tips:
bash command completion, code paths enabled for bind mounts (/users by default)
run more nodes: docker-machine create --driver
Dockerfile/Compose file editor with Visual Studio code
iTerm2 + oh-my-zsh
