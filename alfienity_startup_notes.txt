Steps to building our full stack web app:
1. Ideate (Sticky notes brainstorm)
2. Wireframe UX/UI
3. Choose data structure and type of database (Google Doc the models)
- SQL: tables with predefined schema 
- NoSQL: key-value, document-based, dynamic schema for unstructured data
i.e. Firebase can hold user image uploads in cloud storage, WebSocket integration for real-time updating,
user authentication, OAuth integration
4. Set up repo and agile workflow (i.e. Trello or Waffle.io)
- Create backlog of user stories, develop each story in separate branch, code review, standups, etc.
5. Choose and download a boilerplate
6. Write back-end API routes (or Firebase listeners), Express routes
7. Build a "Proof of Concept" i.e. Victory.JS React library built on D3 for timelines
8. Code out the features
9. Choose and code the design scheme such as Material-UI for components
10. Find and squash bugs or just do test-driven development
11. Deploy the live app such as through Firebase Hosting, Heroku, DigitalOcean
- Buy domain name
