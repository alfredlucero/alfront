AWS Certified Developer Associate Notes (2016):

10000 Feet Overview
- Messaging, Security and Idenitty, Management Tools, Storage, Databases, Networking and Content Delivery, Compute,
AWS Global Infrastructure

- AWS Global Infrastructure - Involves regions and availability zones around the world
-> Region - geographical area, an independent collection of AWS coputing resources in a defined geography, around 11 (2016)
-> each region consists of 2 or more availability zones
-> availability zone (AZ) = a data center, distinct locations from within an AWS region that are engineered to be isolated
from failures
-> Edge location: CDN (content delivery network) endpoints for CloudFront (allows you to cache large media objects in cloud),
more edge locations than regions, points of presence for CloudFront

- Networking and Content Delivery
-> Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): virtual data centers in all the regions around the world where you will deploy your assets
-> Route53: Amazon's DNS services (IP address to domain translation), domain registration, 53 is DNS port
(route 66 first interstate highway across US)
-> CloudFront: Amazon's CDN, edge locations that will cache your assets like large media files
-> Direct Connect: Connecting up your office or physical data centers to AWS using dedicated telephone line for security or
need a reliable internet connection to push a lot of data

- Compute
-> Elastic Computing 2 (EC2): virtual machines in the cloud, can log in through SSH, can install things with the OS
-> EC2 Container Service (ECS): supports Docker containers and running applications on managed cluster of EC2 instances, 
no need to scale and operate your own cluster
-> Elastic Beanstalk: can upload your code application and will provision the underlying infrastructure for your app
-> Lambda: serverless, upload your code and it will respond to events
-> Lightsail: out of the box cloud to deploy say a wordpress or drupal site

- Storage
-> S3 (Simple Storage Service: virtual disk in the cloud where you can store objects such as files, word documents, 
movies, etc.; not to install an
app/game or database (needs block-based storage) i.e. Dropbox uses this
-> Glacier: archive your files from S3 off, low cost, store files for compliance reasons, can't access them immediately
(takes 3-4 hours)
-> EFS (Elastic File Service): file-based storage you can share, can install applications and databases and share it with
multiple applications
-> Storage Gateway: connecing S3 to on premise headquarter, virtual machine image
-> EBS: virtual disk attached to EC2 instance for block-based storage

- Databases
-> RDS (relational database service): includes Postgres, MySQL, Maria, Oracle, Aurora
-> DynamoDB: noSQL database, scalable, high performance
-> Redshift: warehousing service, transfer copy of production database into redshift and run queries on it
-> Elasticache: caching data in cloud to take load off database and return data much quicker

- Migration
-> Snowball: import/export of disks, to move terabytes of data into the cloud
-> DMS (Database Migration Services): migrate on premise database onto AWS cloud or into other regions/AWS services,
uses replication and can convert databases, cheaper than Oracle services
-> SMS (Server Migration Services): targets VMware virtual machines to migrate and replicate them onto AWS cloud,
can do around 50 concurrently at the same time

- Analytics
-> Athena: run SQL queries on S3 buckets like if you want to look at the csv files/objects
-> EMR (Elastic Map Reduce): big data processing
-> Cloud Search: fully managed service for search capabilities in app/website
-> Elastic Search: open source framework service for search capabilities in app/website
-> Kinesis: streaming and analyzing real-time data in massive scale like for financial transactions, social media streams, etc
-> Data Pipeline: lets you move data from one place to another like from S3 into DynamoDB
-> Quick Sight: rich dashboards for data from applications like S3, DynamoDB, etc.

- Security and Identity
-> IAM (Identity Access Management): how you authenticate to AWS, assign user permissions/groups, etc.
-> Inspector: agent installed on VM that inspects those VMs and does security reporting
-> Certifcate Manager: free SSL certificates for domain names
-> Directory Service: connecting up active directory to AWS
-> WAF (Web Application Firewall): application level protection to your website, stop SQL injections/XSS
-> Artifacts: documentation in AWS console, look at compliance docs/certification

- Management Tools:
-> Cloud Watch: monitors performance of your AWS environment like EC2 disk/RAM utilization
-> Cloud Formation: turning your infrastructure into code, can provision production environments into templates and deploy at
will with single command line
-> Cloud Trail: auditing AWS resources and changes to environment
-> Opsworks: automating deployments using chef
-> Config: automatically monitors environment and gives warnings if breaks configurations, set alerts 
-> Service Catalog: designed for larger enterprises with specific images/AWS services to authorize, build out what you 
authorize in the organization
-> Trusted Advisor: gives you tips on how to customize, security fixes, scans environment

- Application Services
-> Step Functions: visualizing what's going on inside applications and which microservices it is using
-> SWF (Simple Work Flow): coordinating both automated and human-led tasks
-> API Gateway: door to allow you to create and secure API that accesses backend data/services
-> AppStream: streaming Desktop applications to your users
-> Elastic Transcoder: changes video format to suit all different devices

- Developer Tools
-> CodeCommit: like Github, place to store your code in the cloud, open/closed
-> CodeBuild: way of compiling your code in different environments, pay by the minute of code build
-> CodeDeploy: way of deploying code to EC2 instances in automated and regulated way
-> CodePipeline: keeps track of different versions of code

- Mobile Services
-> Mobile Hub: console for mobile apps
-> Cognito: easy for users to sign in and sign up into apps
-> Device Farm: improve quality of apps by testing on lots of different devices
-> Mobile Analytics: collect and analyze app usage data
-> Pinpoint: understand and engage with application users, like Google Analytics

- Business Productivity
-> WorkDocs: securely storing work documents
-> WorkMail: exchange for AWS

- Internet of Things
-> iOT: keeping track of iOT devices

- Desktop and App Streaming
-> WorkSpaces: like VDI, having desktop in cloud
-> AppStream 2.0: streaming desktop applications to users

- Artificial Intelligence
-> alexa: voice service in the cloud, communicate using the Echo, talking to Lambda, includes Lex inside (don't need Echo)
-> Polly: helps with rendering voices and different languages
-> Machine Learning: give dataset and tell the outcomes, predict future outcomes based on analysis of training set
-> Rekognition: upload a picture and will give you tags about what is in it, facial recognition

- Messaging
-> SNS (Simple Notification Service): notify via email/text/publish to HTTP endpoints
-> SQS (Simple Queue Service): decoupling your applications, queue system to post jobs to a queue, EC2 instance pulls
SQS jobs and acts upon them
-> SES (Simple Email Service): sending and receiving emails using AWS


Identity Access Management (IAM)
